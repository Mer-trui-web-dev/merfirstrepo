        <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p style="font-family: georgia;">Hi there,<br>My name is Merrill Truideman and I am a recepient of Skillhat's Diverse Tech Talent Program Scholarship.<br>This is my absolute first time being introduced to coding
            and web development and I'm exited to start this journey and see how far it takes me.<br>
            I started my career as a legal drafter for local government and switched to a career in Human Resources and Office Administration, which I am currently still in.
            My interest for IT and Tech overall comes from my love for the internet and all developments that we have experienced in the past years.
            Almost everything I know about being in the online space has been self-thought, but listening to podcasts and browsing the internet and social media made me a bit more curious and
            increased the desire to learn more skills.<br>
            I believe this journey will be a rewarding one. Although not always easy, practice makes perfect and causes the ultimate success.</p>
        <h2>Future Plans</h2>
            <p style="font-family: georgia;">I am taking this all the way; well as far as I can get.<br>
            I have bookmarked some important professional certifications in IT that I want to pursue after this program, which will increase my knowledge even more.
            I want to know as much as possible, because I know that developments are very rapid and it is possible to get lost in it all if you don't keep up.<br>
